# damn vulnerable php webapp

A purposely vulnerable php website, can you get all flags?

Try not to look at the flags in the files but instead, try to figure out how to exploit the vulnerablities.

You can deploy this on replit, use `setup.sh` and `replit-run.sh`

This webapp is aimed at absolute beginners.
